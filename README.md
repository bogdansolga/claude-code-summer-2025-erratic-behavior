# Claude Code Summer 2025 Erratic Behavior

## Why This Repository Exists

Between ~May and August 2025, Claude Code has progressively worsened in behavior, as reported by numerous users in the [Claude Code GitHub repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code). The reported issues include:

- Blatantly ignoring both the instructions from the CLAUDE.md file and the requirements from prompts
- Inventing technical details
- Assuming excessive details without confirmation
- Creating code and not using it, especially in refactoring sessions
- Many other behavioral regressions, summarized in various GitHub issues

This repository serves as a response to the anti-Whac-A-Mole movement against the constant closing of reported issues by the Anthropic team and/or collaborators, without solving them. It aims to document and consolidate these concerns in one place.

## What This Repository Intends to Achieve

The primary goal is to raise awareness and create a critical mass of complaints, ensuring that these behavioral issues will be finally addressed by the development team.

## What This Repository Does NOT Intend to Be

- This is not a 'hall of shame' of the issues plaguing Claude Code recently
- This is not an attempt to denigrate Anthropic's work on Claude Code and their LLMs

The repository exists solely as a constructive effort to highlight persistent issues that need attention for the improvement of Claude Code.
